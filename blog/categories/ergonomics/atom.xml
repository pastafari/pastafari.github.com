    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a desk job, you probably have come across ergonomic chairs and desks and what not.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the simplest commandment to prevent injuries arising out of bad posture is "Stand up and stretch!"</p>

<p>Stretching regularly is easier said than done, because you might often get into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology">flow</a> state (which in itself is a very good thing!) for long periods and forget to do it.</p>

<p>So, I have setup a simple reminder on my Mac that tells me to "Stand up and stretch" every 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I found it was super easy to set this up using AppleScript, and thought I'd share it with the world.</p>

<p>So, if you are a Mac user, open up the AppleScript editor (comes pre installed on OS X, just search with Cmd+Space) and paste this simple code snippet:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3739127.js?file=stretch"></script>


<p>Run the script you just created and voila you have a reminder that will be spoken out loud every 30 minutes!</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/stretching.html">nice set of stretches</a> from ze Canadians.</p>

<p>There are many nifty things that AppleScript and Automator can help with on the Mac! Here's an awesome <a href="http://www.maclife.com/article/features/15_automator_and_applescripts_you_can%E2%80%99t_live_without">bag of tricks</a></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: It does disrupt 'flow' and can get irritating, but if you tweak the frequency of reminders, it is a good tradeoff.</p>
