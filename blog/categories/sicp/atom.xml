    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been wanting to read
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a> for a
while now, and I had gotten started last year but didn't get past
chapter 1. This time I intend to read it through. So I'm setting
myself a quest of reading SICP through. Each Monday I will blog
about the progress I made in the previous week. I will also push my
solutions written in Scheme to my <a href="https://github.com/pastafari/sicp-redux">Github repo</a></p>

<p>I was looking around for others who might have done the same and found
two most excellent folks:
<a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2007/06/19/introducing-the-sicp-reading-notes/">Eli Bendersky</a>
and
<a href="http://www.billthelizard.com/2009/10/sicp-challenge.html">Bill the Lizard</a>
who have walked the walk and been meticulous about blogging their
learnings along the way.</p>

<p>To begin the quest, I am going to put forth my goals quoted verbatim
from
<a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2007/06/19/introducing-the-sicp-reading-notes/">Eli</a>
(because it doesn't get any clearer than this):</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the book</li>
<li>See all the video lectures by Sussman and Abelson themselves
available from
<a href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">here</a></li>
<li>Do most of the interesting exercises in the book</li>
<li>Do some of the larger projects listed
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/psets/index.html">here</a> and
<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-001Spring-2005/CourseHome/index.htm">here</a></li>
</ol>


<p>That said, I spent my first day getting things setup. I now have a
Github repo to host my solutions, an Emacs setup with Scheme mode and
a Scheme REPL (which I got out of the box!) and a physical copy of the
book (I'm old school like that!).</p>

<p>I'm excited about this quest and hope to be regular at it. If any of
you is following along, please do pester me if I don't post at regular
intervals!</p>
