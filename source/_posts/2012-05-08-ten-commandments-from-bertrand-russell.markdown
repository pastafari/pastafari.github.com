I stumbled upon an
[interesting article](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/05/02/a-liberal-decalogue-bertrand-russell/)
about Bertrand Russell's philosophy. Here is a 'Note to self' that is
probably going to be one of the foundations of my lifes philosophy!

> Perhaps the essence of the Liberal outlook could be summed up in a new decalogue, not intended to replace the old one but only to supplement it. The Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate, might be set forth as follows:
> 
> 1. **Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.**
> 2. **Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.**
> 3. **Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.**
> 4. **When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.**
> 5. **Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.**
> 6. **Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.**
> 7. **Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.**
> 8. **Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.**
> 9. **Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.**
> 10. **Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a foolâ€™s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.**
