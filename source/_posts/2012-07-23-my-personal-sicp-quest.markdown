I have been wanting to read
[SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) for a
while now, and I had gotten started last year but didn't get past
chapter 1. This time I intend to read it through. So I'm setting
myself a quest of reading SICP through. Each Monday I will blog
about the progress I made in the previous week. I will also push my
solutions written in Scheme to my [Github repo](https://github.com/pastafari/sicp-redux)

I was looking around for others who might have done the same and found
two most excellent folks:
[Eli Bendersky](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2007/06/19/introducing-the-sicp-reading-notes/)
and
[Bill the Lizard](http://www.billthelizard.com/2009/10/sicp-challenge.html)
who have walked the walk and been meticulous about blogging their
learnings along the way. 

To begin the quest, I am going to put forth my goals quoted verbatim
from
[Eli](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2007/06/19/introducing-the-sicp-reading-notes/)
(because it doesn't get any clearer than this):

1. Read the book  
2. See all the video lectures by Sussman and Abelson themselves
available from
[here](http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/)  
3. Do most of the interesting exercises in the book  
4. Do some of the larger projects listed
[here](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/psets/index.html) and
[here](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-001Spring-2005/CourseHome/index.htm)  

That said, I spent my first day getting things setup. I now have a
Github repo to host my solutions, an Emacs setup with Scheme mode and
a Scheme REPL (which I got out of the box!) and a physical copy of the
book (I'm old school like that!). 

I'm excited about this quest and hope to be regular at it. If any of
you is following along, please do pester me if I don't post at regular
intervals!
