If you have a desk job, you probably have come across ergonomic chairs and desks and what not. 

In my opinion, the simplest commandment to prevent injuries arising out of bad posture is "Stand up and stretch!"

Stretching regularly is easier said than done, because you might often get into a [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology) state (which in itself is a very good thing!) for long periods and forget to do it.

So, I have setup a simple reminder on my Mac that tells me to "Stand up and stretch" every 30 minutes. 

I found it was super easy to set this up using AppleScript, and thought I'd share it with the world.

So, if you are a Mac user, open up the AppleScript editor (comes pre installed on OS X, just search with Cmd+Space) and paste this simple code snippet:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3739127.js?file=stretch"></script>

Run the script you just created and voila you have a reminder that will be spoken out loud every 30 minutes!

Here's a [nice set of stretches](http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/stretching.html) from ze Canadians.

There are many nifty things that AppleScript and Automator can help with on the Mac! Here's an awesome [bag of tricks](http://www.maclife.com/article/features/15_automator_and_applescripts_you_can%E2%80%99t_live_without)

Enjoy! 

Disclaimer: It does disrupt 'flow' and can get irritating, but if you tweak the frequency of reminders, it is a good tradeoff.
